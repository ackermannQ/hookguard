# 🧠 HookGuard — Auditing Hook Behavior in React Codebases

HookGuard is a powerful developer tool designed to detect unsafe, complex, or undocumented behaviors in React hooks — both built-in and custom. It helps teams maintain scalable, clean, and predictable component logic by uncovering patterns that often lead to bugs, performance issues, or architectural rot.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

**Goal:** Provide visibility and control over the complexity of React components and hooks.  
HookGuard identifies:

- Hooks with uncleaned side effects ✅
- Repeated, nested, or coupled network ✅
- Shared logic with hidden state dependencies ⚙️
- Custom hooks doing more than advertised ⚙️
- Inconsistent or conditional hook usage ⚙️

```

> If you don't want to comment on the PR you can remove the corresponding step.

## 🚀 Usage

Run `hookguard scan <directory>` to scan a directory recursively for hooks.

Run `hookguard report <reportFile>` to print a summary of the scan results.

## 🎛️ Configuration – hookguard.config.ts

You can customize HookGuard's behavior by creating a `hookguard.config.ts` file in the root of your project.

This configuration file allows you to:

- Enable or disable specific rules
- Set thresholds to fail CI on certain risk conditions
- Define custom suspicious calls to track (e.g. setSession, setGlobalState)

🧪 Example

```ts
// hookguard.config.ts
import { HookRule, RuleResult } from "./src/rules/Rule";
import { HookInfo } from "./src/scanner/hookExtractor";
import { HookGuardConfig } from "./src/config/defaultConfig";

/**
 * Fake rule for demonstration purposes
 */
export class FakeRule implements HookRule {
  id = "fake-rule";
  description = "It's a fake rule for demonstration purposes";

  appliesTo(hook: HookInfo): boolean {
    return hook.name === "useEffect";
  }

  evaluate(hook: HookInfo): RuleResult | null {
    return {
      ruleId: this.id,
      level: "info",
      message: "It's a useEffect hook!",
      suggestions: [
        "Write here some suggestions for ensuring the rules is respected",
      ],
    };
  }
}

export const config: HookGuardConfig = {
  customRules: { "fake-rule": new FakeRule() },
  rules: {
    "no-cleanup": true,
    "unsafe-network": true,
    "excessive-dependencies": true,
    "missing-dependency": false,
    "async-effect": false,
    "fake-rule": true,
  },
  thresholds: {
    failOnScore: undefined,
    failOnCritical: false,
  },
  suspiciousCalls: [
    "setUser",
    "setAuth",
    "setSession",
    "setTheme",
    "setLocale",
    "setLanguage",
    "setSettings",
  ],
};
```

> If the file is missing or invalid, HookGuard will fall back to default configuration.
> You can create your own set of rules by creating new classes that implement the `HookRule` interface. Don't forget to add them to the `customRules` and `rules` objects in the configuration file.
