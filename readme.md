# üß† HookGuard ‚Äî Auditing Hook Behavior in React Codebases

HookGuard is a powerful developer tool designed to detect unsafe, complex, or undocumented behaviors in React hooks ‚Äî both built-in and custom. It helps teams maintain scalable, clean, and predictable component logic by uncovering patterns that often lead to bugs, performance issues, or architectural rot.

---

## üöÄ Project Objective

**Goal:** Provide visibility and control over the complexity of React components and hooks.  
HookGuard identifies:

- Hooks with uncleaned side effects
- Repeated, nested, or coupled network calls
- Shared logic with hidden state dependencies
- Custom hooks doing more than advertised
- Inconsistent or conditional hook usage

---

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Action

Create a file named `.github/workflows/hookguard.yml` with the following contents:

```yaml
name: HookGuard Scan

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - "src/**"
      - "**.ts"
      - "**.tsx"

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          corepack enable
          npm install

      - name: HookGuard Scan
        run: |
          npx hookguard scan ./src

      - name: HookGuard Report
        run: |
          npx hookguard report $(ls -t ./data/hookguard-log-*.json | head -n1)

      - name: Generate markdown summary
        run: |
          HG_MARKDOWN=1 npx hookguard report $(ls -t ./data/hookguard-log-*.json | head -n1) > hookguard-summary.md

      - name: Comment markdown summary on PR
        uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
        with:
          path: hookguard-summary.md
```

> If you don't want to comment on the PR you can remove the corresponding step.

## Usage

Run `hookguard scan <directory>` to scan a directory recursively for hooks.

Run `hookguard report <reportFile>` to print a summary of the scan results.

## üìÖ Development Timeline

### üß™ Week 1: MVP & Core Engine

- [x] CLI to scan a codebase: `hookguard scan ./src`
- [x] File discovery (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`)
- [x] AST parsing (using `ts-morph`)
- [x] Detection of:
  - `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`
  - Custom hooks (`use*`)
- [x] Extraction of:
  - Hook name, dependencies, contents
  - Network calls (`fetch`, `axios`, etc.)
  - Global state updates
  - Cleanup function presence
- [x] JSON report output

### üß† Week 2‚Äì3: Rule Engine & Scoring System

- [x] Modular rule engine (Chain of Responsibility)
- [x] Detection rules:
  - Missing cleanup
  - Conditioned hook execution
  - Unsafe network call without cancellation
  - Excessive setState or context mutation
- [x] Risk scoring system per hook
- [x] Summary dashboard per file/component

### üîÅ Week 4: CI / Git Integration

- [x] GitHub Action: run HookGuard on PRs
- [ ] PR comment with summary of risks
- [ ] Risk diffing: new vs. resolved hook issues
- [ ] Badge for "clean hooks"
- [ ] Config file support (`hookguard.config.ts`)

> _(Optional backend/database integration to persist reports per branch or commit, store diffs and long-term analytics)_

### üñºÔ∏è Week 5‚Äì6: UI & Visualization Layer

- [ ] React web UI for browsing reports
- [ ] Hook graph: links between components and state
- [ ] Filtering by severity, module, team
- [ ] Export to Notion/Markdown/CSV
- [ ] Caching layer (Redis or local FS-based) for fast reloads and diff views

> _(Requires lightweight backend API to serve cache and persistent report data)_

### üí° Week 7‚Äì8: IntelliSense & On-the-fly Detection

- [ ] VS Code extension (or Language Server) to:
  - Highlight risky hook usage as you type
  - Auto-suggest cleanup patterns
  - Provide tooltip summaries for custom hooks
- [ ] Optional integration with ESLint for live feedback

> _(Requires bundling a local lightweight engine or pre-built ruleset into the extension)_

### üìä Week 9‚Äì10: Insights & Intelligence

- [ ] Time-based tracking of risk accumulation
- [ ] Suggested refactor targets (e.g. extract effect)
- [ ] Historical snapshots per branch or tag
- [ ] Visualization of "hot files"

> _(Requires lightweight database or file-backed store for snapshots)_

### üåê Week 11‚Äì12: Framework Extension & Custom Rules

- [ ] Support for Vue 3 `setup()` + Composition API
- [ ] Plugin system for custom rules
- [ ] LLM-assisted refactoring suggestion
- [ ] Community rule library
- [ ] Self-hosted UI dashboard (Docker-ready)

## üß± Core Architecture

- **CLI**: Entry point, options parser
- **Scanner**: File system + AST parser
- **HookNode**: Internal model (hook metadata + diagnostics)
- **Rule Engine**: Modular rule executor
- **Report Formatter**: Markdown/JSON builders
- **UI Frontend**: Report visualizer (optional)
- **Cache**: File-based or Redis-backed for fast repeated analysis
- **Extension SDK**: For LSP or IDE plugins

---

## ‚úÖ Use Cases

- Audit a codebase before major refactor
- Enforce hook hygiene in a growing team
- Assist onboarding by highlighting complex logic
- Justify architectural changes with risk metrics
- Detect dangerous patterns in-flight (with IDE integration)

---

## üë• Target Users

- React developers
- Tech leads & Staff Engineers
- Architects auditing app complexity
- QA / DevEx teams supporting frontend teams
